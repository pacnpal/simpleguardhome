# SimpleGuardHome 404 Checker Userscript

A Tampermonkey userscript that detects 404 responses while browsing and automatically checks if the domains are blocked by your AdGuard Home instance. This helps identify when DNS blocking might be causing page load failures.

## Features

- Automatically detects 404 responses from both fetch and XMLHttpRequest calls
- Checks failed domains against your AdGuard Home instance
- Shows notifications for blocked domains with one-click unblock button
- Directly unblocks domains using SimpleGuardHome API
- Configurable AdGuard Home instance settings
- Caches results to minimize API calls
- Error handling with configuration shortcuts

## Installation

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension
2. Click on the Tampermonkey icon and select "Create a new script"
3. Copy the contents of `simpleguardhome-404-checker.user.js` into the editor
4. Save the script (Ctrl+S or File -> Save)

## Configuration

### Initial Setup
1. Click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser
2. Select "‚öôÔ∏è Configure SimpleGuardHome" under the script's menu
3. Review your current settings (if any)
4. Enter new host and port settings
5. Connection test will be performed automatically
   - Success: Settings are saved immediately
   - Failure: Option to save anyway or retry

### Menu Options
- "‚öôÔ∏è Configure SimpleGuardHome" - Open configuration dialog
- "üîÑ Test Connection" - Test current settings

### Default Settings
- Host: `http://localhost`
- Port: `8000` (SimpleGuardHome default port)

### Connection Testing
- Automatic testing when saving new settings
- Manual testing available through menu
- Clear notifications of test results
- Option to save settings even if test fails

## How It Works

1. The script monitors all web requests on any website
2. When a 404 response is detected:
   - Extracts the domain from the failed URL
   - Checks if the domain is blocked by AdGuard Home
   - Shows a notification with status if domain is blocked
   - Provides a one-click "Unblock Domain" button
   - Directly unblocks domain when button is clicked
   - Shows success/error notification after unblock attempt

3. Error handling:
   - Connection issues show a notification with configuration options
   - Results are cached for 1 hour to reduce API load
   - Failed requests provide clear error messages

## Technical Details

### Required Permissions
- `GM_xmlhttpRequest`: For making cross-origin requests to AdGuard Home
- `GM_getValue`/`GM_setValue`: For storing configuration
- `GM_registerMenuCommand`: For adding configuration menu
- `@connect *`: For connecting to custom AdGuard Home instances

### Cache System
- Domain check results are cached for 1 hour
- Cache includes:
  - Block status (true/false)
  - Timestamp
- Cache is updated when:
  - Domain is checked (status: "not blocked", "blocked")
  - Domain is unblocked (status: "already unblocked", "has been unblocked")

### Error Handling
- Connection failures
- Request timeouts
- API errors
- JSON parsing errors

## Development

The userscript is part of the SimpleGuardHome project and is designed to complement the main application by providing real-time feedback during web browsing.

To modify or extend the script:
1. Make changes to `simpleguardhome-404-checker.user.js`
2. Update version number in the metadata block
3. Reinstall in Tampermonkey to test changes
